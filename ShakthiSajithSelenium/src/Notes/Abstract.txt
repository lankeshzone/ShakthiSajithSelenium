1) abstract keyword should be used to create abstract methods
2) abstract method do not have method body(code to implement)
3) n-number of abstract methods can be their in a class
4) if their is an abstract method in a class then the class itself becomes abstract... use abstract keyword infront of class...
5) an object of abstract class is not possible..
6) can run the abstract class as a normal class
7) abstract methods will be implemented in a child class..
